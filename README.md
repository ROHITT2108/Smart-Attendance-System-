# Smart-Attendance-System



## Overview

The Smart Attendance System is designed to automate the attendance process across various environments, such as schools, offices, and events. Built using an Arduino Uno alongside an LCD display, I2C module, and GSM module, the system offers an efficient, user-friendly solution for tracking attendance in real-time.

## Features

- Easy-to-Use Interface: Simple process for user registration and attendance marking.
- Real-Time Feedback: Immediate system feedback displayed on the LCD, confirming user actions and system status.
- Flexible Identification Options: Choose from various identification methods like RFID, fingerprint, or QR code.
- Data Storage & Transmission: Supports local data storage on an SD card or remote data transmission via GSM.
- Highly Customizable: Easily adaptable to meet specific needs or requirements for different settings.
